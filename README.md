# Othello(Reversi)

Othello or Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. It was invented in 1883. Othello, a variant with a change to the board's initial setup, was patented in 1971.

This was my AP(Advance Programming) course project of my university second semester 2019 - 2020 (1398 - 1399). It is a simple implementation of the Othollo game in Java (without GUI). 



## Installation

Just download the file of classes, put them on a same directory(a same folder).



## Usage

compile them(you must have JDK(Java Development Kit) on your system. you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html)) and then run the Run class.


comile step:
```bash
$ javac *.java
```
start the game:
```bash
$ java Run
```

WARNNIG: for a colorfull output in terminal, I used ANSI codes and some emojis. So you can't compile and run it on Windows OS.



## Contributing
This project has a simple AI (int Bot class) and dosen't have GUI. 
So pull requests are welcome for this parts or other changes that make it better



### A quick overview of classes:
    * *Run*: the main class of the game (includes main method)
    * *Rules*: for check the game rules and apply players chooses
